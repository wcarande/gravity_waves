Identification of Gravity Waves in AIM CIPS RAA Data Using Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to identify gravity waves in AIM CIPS Rayleigh Albedo Anomaly (RAA) data.

The structure of this repo is as follows:

├── CIPS

│   ├── code

│   │   ├── notebooks

│   ├── poster

│   │   ├── images

│   ├── references

The code/notebooks folder contains processing.ipynb which creates a text file with the dissimilarity and correlation values for each image. raa_plotting.ipynb is the main notebook withdata analysis and model fitting.

The final presentation can be found in the posters folder in both PPT and PDF formats.

The references folder contains information about AIM CIPS data types.
